Our codes are divided into two ipynb files for Wine and Kidney datasets. Because we have modified the original CSV files to add an additional row for the identification of the features, Thus, we also upload our new CSV files. We also mention this in the cell of the reading file in ipynb.

-----------First part of code-----------
read files and data visualization
-----------Second part of code------------
all Functions apply to the testing of the logistic regression model
-----------Third part of code-------------
Run all testing in 3 different models (linear, quadratic, cubic)
And the final part of the cells run the final model result  


#### our ipynb files also include the explanation for every code #######
